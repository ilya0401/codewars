Donald trump has never been shy about expressing his fondness for tariffs. But prior to his return to the White House, many of his supporters thought it more of a negotiating ploy: an aggressive stance meant to prod other countries into concessions. This comforting story now looks like fantasy. Mr Trump has shown himself to be a true believer in trade protectionism. In the process he has raised the average effective tariff on goods entering America from 2.5% last year to about 20%, the highest since the Great Depression. The policy process has been chaotic, to put it politely, and that disorder offers a forecast of how Mr Trump may swerve and improvise toward an outcome that preserves as much of his vision of a remade American trade regime as markets, courts and the Republican Party will allow. To judge where he may end up, it is useful to remember where he began. On the campaign trail Mr Trump spoke of a universal tariff of 10-20% and a China-specific levy of 60%. If only things had been that tidy. Instead, Mr Trump has thrown together a hotch-potch of product-focused and country-specific levies, only to roll back some, pause others and threaten still more. In his first term Mr Trump relied on statutes that allow the White House to impose limited tariffs. This time, he has invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a law that grants the president far greater leeway. For Canada and Mexico he declared an emergency over fentanyl smuggling and illegal immigration. For “reciprocal” tariffs on all countries he said that trade deficits themselves constituted an emergency.
